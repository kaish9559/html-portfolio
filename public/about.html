<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Abdul Kaish, an enthusiastic and dedicated Chemical Engineering graduate pursuing my MTech 
in Chemical Engineering at IIT Kanpur focusing on catalysis and reaction engineering. My academic journey has been marked by excellence,
 as evidenced by my impressive 9.133 CPI during my BTech in Petrochemical Engineering from Aligarh Muslim University.</p>

<p>During my undergraduate studies, I actively engaged in a comprehensive project involving the production of 10,000 tons of 
purified terephthalic acid using the Amoco Process. This endeavour allowed me to delve into various chemical engineering facets, 
from literature review and process description to material and energy balances, equipment design, cost estimation, instrumentation
 and control, plant location, and HAZOP Study.</p>
<p> I'm currently immersed in my thesis work, where I'm utilizing ab initio 
molecular dynamics simulations using the density functional theory (DFT)to determine the activation energy of methane dissociation in a molten metal catalyst of In-Ni. 
This involves employing Density Functional Theory and the VASP software for atomic simulations. My hands-on experience includes proficiency 
in Aspen Plus, Matlab, Python, Excel, and DWSIM, showcasing my versatility in applying 
theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.</p>
<p>Beyond academics, I've actively participated in extracurricular activities, contributing as an organizing team member for 
Research Scholar Day and volunteering in the Orientation program. These experiences have enriched my interpersonal skills and 
ability to work collaboratively in diverse environments.</p>
<p>I'm also skilled in data analysis, SQL, Machine Learning and have done an internship on financial risk analytics and a project on hotel
 booking data analysis.</p>
<p>Driven by curiosity, I approach challenges with a thirst for knowledge and a commitment to excellence. I believe in the power of 
dedication and discipline, qualities that have consistently propelled me towards success.

In the future, I am eager to apply my skills in practical settings and explore new opportunities. If you are looking for a dynamic
 and motivated professional with a strong foundation in chemical engineering, I would love to connect and discuss potential collaboration</p>
